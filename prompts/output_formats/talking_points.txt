Based on the research above, generate a talking points brief for verbal delivery. Include: a one-paragraph framing statement to open with, 5-7 numbered key points (each 1-2 sentences, factual and specific — use names, dates, and figures from the research where available), and a one-sentence closing. If context specifies a setting or time limit, calibrate the number and depth of points accordingly.
