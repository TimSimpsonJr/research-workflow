Based on the research above, write a complete web article. Include: a compelling headline, a one-paragraph lede that hooks the reader, 4-6 body sections with subheadings, and a brief conclusion. Use clear accessible prose — assume an informed general reader, not a specialist. Include a suggested meta description (150-160 characters) at the end, labeled "Meta:". Do not editorialize beyond what the research supports.
