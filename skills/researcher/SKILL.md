# Research -- v3 Orchestrator (Multi-Hop Pipeline)

You are the orchestrator. You run a stateful multi-stage research pipeline that searches, fetches, summarizes, classifies, and writes vault notes -- with optional multi-hop investigation gated by confidence scoring. You dispatch Haiku subagents for cheap parallel work, Sonnet for resolver and hop-planner, and write final notes yourself (or escalate to Opus for synthesis notes).

## Bootstrap Constants

- `VAULT` = `{{VAULT_ROOT}}`
- `REPO` = `{{REPO_ROOT}}`
- `SCRIPTS` = `REPO/scripts`
- `STATE_DIR` = `VAULT/.researcher/state`
- `CASES_DIR` = `VAULT/.researcher/cases`

---

## Stage 0: Load Config and Detect Tier

### 0a. Load config

First, migrate any existing vault state from the pre-rename directory name
(`.research-workflow/` -> `.researcher/`). This is one-time and idempotent -- a
no-op for new vaults or vaults already migrated. Run via Bash:
```bash
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from migrate import migrate_vault_dir
from pathlib import Path
print(migrate_vault_dir(Path('VAULT')))
"
```
This prints `migrated`, `noop`, or `conflict`. If it prints `conflict`, warn the
user that both `.research-workflow/` and `.researcher/` exist under the vault and
a manual merge is needed, then continue (config loads from `.researcher/`).

Then load config. Run via Bash:
```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from config_manager import load_config
from pathlib import Path
cfg = load_config(Path('VAULT'))
if cfg is None:
    print('ERROR: No config found. Run /researcher-setup first.')
    sys.exit(1)
print(json.dumps(cfg))
"
```

Parse the JSON output. Extract and store:
- `ASSETS_DIR` = `VAULT/{cfg.assets}` (typically `VAULT/assets`)
- `OLLAMA_MODEL` = `cfg.ollama_model` (may be null)
- `SEARXNG_URL` = `cfg.searxng_url` (may be null)

If the command prints `ERROR:`, output the error and stop.

### 0b. Detect tier (with auto-start and degradation alert)

Run via Bash:
```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from detect_tier import build_tier_report
from pathlib import Path
report = build_tier_report(SEARXNG_URL, Path('REPO'))
print(json.dumps(report))
"
```

Substitute `SEARXNG_URL` with the value from config (Python `None` if null, or the quoted string URL). Substitute `REPO` with the repo root path.

Parse the JSON. Extract and store:
- `TIER` = `report.tier`
- `OLLAMA_AVAILABLE` = `report.components.ollama.status == "ok"`
- `RECOMMENDED_MODEL` = `report.components.ollama.model` (if present)
- `SEARXNG_AVAILABLE` = `report.components.searxng.status == "ok"`
- `YTDLP_AVAILABLE` = `report.components.ytdlp.status == "ok"`
- `WHISPER_AVAILABLE` = `report.components.whisper.status == "ok"`

**If `report.degraded` is true**, show the user a tier alert:

```
⚠️  Running at {TIER} tier (max available: full)

Missing:
{for each item in missing_for_full:}
  - {item}
{end}

Impact:
  - mid tier: No SearXNG search merging — search uses Claude WebSearch only
  - base tier: No local summarization — all summarization uses Haiku (higher API cost)

Continue at {TIER} tier? [yes / fix and retry / cancel]
```

Wait for user response:
- **yes:** Continue with the degraded tier.
- **fix and retry:** Stop the pipeline. The user will fix the issue and re-run `/researcher`.
- **cancel:** Stop the pipeline entirely.

If SearXNG was auto-started (check `report.components.searxng.auto_started`), log:
`SearXNG container auto-started successfully.`

**If `report.degraded` is false** (tier is `full`), continue silently.

### 0c. Update vault index

Run via Bash:
```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from vault_index import update_index
from pathlib import Path
stats = update_index(Path('VAULT'))
print(json.dumps(stats))
"
```

This ensures the FTS5 index is current before any agent queries it. Log the stats but do not block on them.

---

## Stage 1: Check for Active Run

Run via Bash:
```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import load_run, is_stale_run
from pathlib import Path
state_dir = Path('STATE_DIR')
r = load_run(state_dir)
if r is None:
    print('null')
else:
    r['is_stale'] = is_stale_run(state_dir)
    print(json.dumps(r))
"
```

**If `null`:** No active run. Proceed to Stage 2.

**If a run exists:**

Show the user:
```
Incomplete run detected: "{run_id}"
Stage: {stage}
Started: {started_at}
{if is_stale: "WARNING: This run is over 24 hours old."}

Resume / Restart / Abandon?
```

Use the user's response:
- **Resume:** Skip to the stage recorded in `stage`. Load any saved stage outputs from `STATE_DIR` and continue from there.
- **Restart:** Run `python -c "from state import abandon_run; abandon_run(Path('STATE_DIR'))"` via Bash, then proceed to Stage 2.
- **Abandon:** Run the same abandon command and stop.

If `state.load_run()` returned None and the user just ran /researcher (no other reason for that), it may be that an old-schema (v2) run was abandoned silently. Stage 0's config load already printed the migration message -- no further action needed.

---

## Stage 2: Triage

The resolver classifies the prompt's strategy before resolving topics. The run is created at the START of this stage so that any downstream state-writing helper (`save_state`, `record_hop`, `add_usage`, etc.) has somewhere to write to -- even when the planning_only path bypasses Stage 3's full approval flow.

### 2a. Create the run

Generate a run ID from the current date and a slugified version of the user's input (e.g., `2026-03-05-sc-alpr-research`). Then:

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import create_run, update_stage
from pathlib import Path
state_dir = Path('STATE_DIR')
r = create_run(state_dir, 'RUN_ID', 'TIER')
update_stage(state_dir, 'triage')
print(json.dumps(r))
"
```

The run begins with no topics; topics are populated after the resolver returns (in 2c.iv or Stage 3).

### 2b. Dispatch topic-resolver agent (Sonnet)

Read the agent definition: `REPO/agents/topic-resolver.md`

Dispatch via the Task tool:
- `subagent_type`: `general-purpose`
- `model`: `sonnet`
- `prompt`: The full contents of `agents/topic-resolver.md`, followed by a `---` separator, followed by:

```
prompt: {the user's original input}
vault_root: {VAULT}
scripts_dir: {SCRIPTS}
```

### 2c. Parse strategy and persist it

The agent returns a JSON object. Read the top-level `strategy` field.

**Persist the strategy immediately** -- every path through Stage 2 ends up needing `run["strategy"]` set, so save it before branching. (`intent_planning` runs may re-dispatch in 2d and produce a different strategy; that re-dispatch overwrites this value.)

```bash
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import load_run, save_state
from pathlib import Path
run = load_run(Path('STATE_DIR'))
run['strategy'] = 'STRATEGY_VALUE_FROM_RESOLVER'
save_state(Path('STATE_DIR'), run)
"
```

Then branch by strategy:

- `planning_only`: continue to Stage 2e (one-line confirm) with the resolved topics from this response, then Stage 2f.
- `intent_planning`: continue to Stage 2d (Q&A loop).
- `unified`: continue to Stage 3 (full resolve+plan flow with depth column), then Stage 2f before Stage 4. Note: the resolver has ALREADY produced topics; Stage 3 uses them rather than re-dispatching.

### 2d. Intent-planning Q&A (if applicable)

If strategy is `intent_planning`, the response contains `clarifying_questions[]` and topics are not yet resolved. For each question (max 3 for single-topic, max 1 for batch):

1. Present the question to the user.
2. Wait for the user's response.
3. Append the answer to the running prompt context.

After all questions are answered, re-dispatch the topic-resolver with the augmented prompt:

```
prompt: {original input}
clarifying_qa: {array of {question, answer} pairs}
vault_root: {VAULT}
scripts_dir: {SCRIPTS}
```

Expect the new response to have `strategy: "unified"` (rare cases: `planning_only`).

**Re-persist the strategy from the second response.** The first dispatch persisted `"intent_planning"` in 2c; that value is now stale because the clarified resolver may have returned a different strategy.

```bash
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import load_run, save_state
from pathlib import Path
run = load_run(Path('STATE_DIR'))
run['strategy'] = 'NEW_STRATEGY_FROM_SECOND_DISPATCH'
save_state(Path('STATE_DIR'), run)
"
```

Then continue to 2e or Stage 3 accordingly.

If the user abandons mid-Q&A (cancel / explicit abort), call `abandon_run(STATE_DIR)` and stop.

### 2e. Planning-only confirm (skip if strategy is unified)

Only entered when strategy is `planning_only`. Show the user:

```
Researching {project} at depth {topic.depth}, ~{estimated_minutes}min. Proceed? [yes / edit / cancel]
```

- `yes`: initialize topics from the resolver response (see snippet below), then run Stage 2f, then skip to Stage 4 (hop loop). Stage 3 is bypassed. Strategy was already persisted in 2c.
- `edit`: upgrade to `unified` strategy -- present the full plan as in Stage 3a below. The run is already created; Stage 3 will populate topics and approve. Also overwrite `run['strategy'] = 'unified'` since the user chose to upgrade.
- `cancel`: call `abandon_run(STATE_DIR)` and stop.

When `yes`: initialize topics now (since Stage 3 is being skipped), then advance the stage marker to `hop_loop` so a crash before Stage 4 resumes at the right place (not back at `triage`):

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import load_run, save_state, init_topic, update_stage
from pathlib import Path
state_dir = Path('STATE_DIR')
run = load_run(state_dir)
# RESOLVER_RESPONSE is the parsed JSON from Stage 2b/2d; substitute its topics list.
plan_topics = RESOLVER_RESPONSE['topics']
run['topics'] = [init_topic(t['topic'], t['mode'], t['depth']) for t in plan_topics]
save_state(state_dir, run)
update_stage(state_dir, 'hop_loop')
"
```

Note: strategy persistence now happens once in Stage 2c (immediately after the resolver returns), so every path through Stage 2 ends with `run["strategy"]` set.

### 2f. Load learned patterns (v3.1.0)

**When to run:** Once per /researcher invocation, after Stage 2 has selected a strategy and Stage 3 has produced the resolved topics list. Every path through Stage 2 (planning_only via 2e, intent_planning via 2d->2e, unified via Stage 3) must run Stage 2f BEFORE entering Stage 4 -- Stage 4a/4e and Stage 6 rely on `LEARNED_BY_STAGE` being populated by 2f. If you got here from 2e's `yes` branch, run 2f next, then enter Stage 4. If you got here from Stage 3b, run 2f, then enter Stage 4.

Run via Bash:

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from learned_patterns import load_learned_patterns, filter_by_topic_text, group_by_stage
from pathlib import Path
lp, _warnings = load_learned_patterns(Path('LEARNED_PATTERNS_PATH'))
relevant = filter_by_topic_text(lp, topics=TOPIC_STRINGS)
grouped = group_by_stage(relevant)
print(json.dumps({stage: [p.id for p in patterns] for stage, patterns in grouped.items()}))
"
```

Substitute `LEARNED_PATTERNS_PATH` with `{VAULT}/.researcher/learned_patterns.md`. Substitute `TOPIC_STRINGS` with the list of topic strings from the resolver output (Stage 3's `final['topics']` -- use each topic's `topic` field).

**Why topic-text matching, not `domain_tags` matching at this stage:** v3.0.0 only derives `domain_tags` at case-write time (Stage 10c), computed from tags assigned to written notes. At Stage 2 no notes exist yet. Topic strings are the strongest signal we have for relevance. Stage 10d's analyzer uses real `domain_tags` from the just-written case via `filter_relevant`.

**Known limitation of substring-only matching:** patterns tagged with high-level concepts that don't appear verbatim in topic text (e.g., a pattern tagged `["civic"]` from a prior run won't match the topic `"ALPR programs in Greenville"` because "civic" isn't in the topic string). This is intentional for v3.1.0 -- broader semantic matching would require an additional classification step at Stage 2 (cost we don't want to pay yet). The user benefits less from learned patterns early in a run but gets full credit at Stage 10b scoring once `domain_tags` are derived from written notes. Revisit for v3.2.0 if real usage shows this is too lossy.

Parse the JSON output and store:
- `LEARNED_BY_STAGE` = the returned dict mapping `search` / `hop_planner` / `classify` -> list of pattern IDs

If the file doesn't exist or returns empty, set `LEARNED_BY_STAGE = {"search": [], "hop_planner": [], "classify": []}`. Continue silently.

---

## Stage 3: Resolve

Stage 3 runs ONLY for `unified` strategy. The run was already created in Stage 2a and the resolver already dispatched in Stage 2b -- here we just present the plan and save the approval. Transition stage first:

```bash
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import update_stage
from pathlib import Path
update_stage(Path('STATE_DIR'), 'resolve')
"
```

### 3a. Present plan for approval

Show the user (using the resolver response from Stage 2c):
```
Research Plan: {project}

Topics ({count}):
{for each topic:}
  - [{depth}] {topic} ({mode})
{end}

{if local_sources:}
Local files ({count}):
{for each source:}
  - {path} ({type})
{end}
{end}

{if thread_pulls:}
Thread pulls ({count}):
{for each pull:}
  - From: {source_note}
    Leads: {extracted_leads joined}
{end}
{end}

Estimated usage:
  Search:    {search_agents} Haiku agents
  Summarize: {summarize_calls} calls ({if OLLAMA_AVAILABLE: "Ollama" else: "Haiku"})
  Classify:  {classify_agents} Haiku agent
  Write:     {write_messages}
  Total:     {total_claude_messages} Claude messages

Tier: {TIER}

Proceed? [yes / edit / cancel]
```

Wait for user response via the conversation:
- **yes / proceed:** Continue to 3b.
- **edit:** Let the user modify topics, modes, and depths, then re-display the plan.
- **cancel:** Abandon the run and stop.

### 3b. Save plan

Initialize per-topic state using `init_topic` and save the research plan. The run already exists (created in Stage 2a), so we append topics to it rather than re-create:

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import load_run, save_state, init_topic, update_stage, save_stage_output
from pathlib import Path
state_dir = Path('STATE_DIR')
run = load_run(state_dir)
plan_topics = PLAN_JSON['topics']
run['topics'] = [init_topic(t['topic'], t['mode'], t['depth']) for t in plan_topics]
save_state(state_dir, run)
update_stage(state_dir, 'hop_loop')
save_stage_output(state_dir, 'research_plan', PLAN_JSON)
"
```

Where `PLAN_JSON` is the parsed JSON from the resolver, serialized as a Python dict literal.

Run Stage 2f before entering Stage 4.

---

## Stage 4: Hop Loop

For each hop level from 1 to the maximum `max_hops` across all topics, run the search->fetch->media->summarize->hop-planner sequence for all topics that are still active at this level.

Loop structure:

```python
hop_level = 1
while any(t.status == "active" and t.current_hop < t.max_hops for t in run.topics):
    active = [t for t in run.topics if t.status == "active" and t.current_hop < t.max_hops]

    # 4a-4d: process this hop level for all active topics
    # See substages below.

    # 4e: hop-planner decides continue/stop/replan per topic
    for topic in active:
        dispatch hop-planner
        apply decision

    hop_level += 1
```

### 4a. Search (parallel across topics)

For each active topic, choose hop_context based on how the topic got admitted at this iteration:

- **Hop 1 (fresh topic):** dispatch search-agent normally with `topic`, `existing_urls`, `depth`. No hop_context preamble.

- **Hop 2+ following a hop-planner `continue` decision:** the prior hop-planner returned `next_hop`, which Stage 4e persisted to `topic.next_hop`. Read it from state:
  - `pattern`: `topic.next_hop.pattern`
  - `from`: `topic.next_hop.from`
  - `seen_urls`: the topic's seen_urls list

  **Do not clear `next_hop` here.** Stage 4e will overwrite it (or set it to None on stop/replan) when the new hop-planner response lands. Clearing eagerly in 4a would leave the in-flight hop with no routing state if the process crashes between 4a and 4e -- resume could not reconstruct `hop_context`.

- **Hop following a quality-gate replan (Stage 5b or 5c re-admission):** the topic has a stored `replan_hint` instead of a prior `next_hop`. Read it (don't clear):
  - `pattern`: `topic.replan_hint.suggested_pattern`
  - `from`: `topic.replan_hint.suggested_query_focus` (treated as the focus topic/entity for the search)
  - `seen_urls`: the topic's seen_urls list
  - Optional: include the `issue` field as a brief addition to the preamble (e.g., "previous gap: thin sources")

  **Do not clear `replan_hint` here either.** Stage 4e's continue branch is the one place that clears it (via `set_replan_hint(topic, None)`); the stop and replan branches leave it alone or overwrite it. This keeps the hop's routing context durable across crashes.

**Routing precedence for Stage 4a:** when both `next_hop` and `replan_hint` are set (shouldn't happen in normal operation but possible after partial fixes), prefer `replan_hint` -- it's the more recent quality-gate intent. Stage 4e's continue branch handles the cleanup by clearing `replan_hint` once a hop completes successfully, so the precedence collision is short-lived.

The search-agent's prompt template doesn't change. The orchestrator prepends a hop-context preamble for hop 2+:

```
HOP CONTEXT: This is hop {N} of {max_hops} for topic "{topic}". Use the {pattern} pattern, focusing on "{from}". Skip URLs in seen_urls.
{if replan_hint: "Previous gap: " + replan_hint.issue}
```

**Learned-pattern injection (v3.1.0):** if `LEARNED_BY_STAGE["search"]` is non-empty, ALSO load each pattern's full record and append a `## Learned Patterns` block to the search-agent prompt:

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from learned_patterns import load_learned_patterns
from pathlib import Path
lp, _warnings = load_learned_patterns(Path('LEARNED_PATTERNS_PATH'))
ids = LEARNED_IDS_FOR_STAGE
out = [{'id': p.id, 'name': p.name, 'body': p.body} for p in lp.patterns if p.id in ids]
print(json.dumps(out))
"
```

Substitute `LEARNED_PATTERNS_PATH` with `{VAULT}/.researcher/learned_patterns.md` and pass `LEARNED_IDS_FOR_STAGE` as the list `LEARNED_BY_STAGE["search"]`.

Build a `## Learned Patterns` block from the returned records (4-space indented to show the literal markdown the orchestrator emits):

    ## Learned Patterns (from prior runs, may or may not apply)

    - **{name}** -- {body}

    (repeat per pattern)

Append this block to the search-agent's user prompt under the existing context. Then, for each pattern surfaced, record it in run state:

```bash
python -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import record_applied_pattern
from pathlib import Path
record_applied_pattern(Path('STATE_DIR'), 'PATTERN_ID')
"
```

Run once per pattern id.

Batch dispatches at <=5 topics per round.

After dispatch, collect all `selected_urls` arrays from the search agent responses (and merge SearXNG results when `SEARXNG_AVAILABLE`, deduplicating by URL). Build a per-hop `search_context_hop{N}.json` file in `STATE_DIR/` keyed off active topics for this iteration.

### 4b. Fetch

Run `fetch_and_clean.py` once for all active topics' selected URLs at this hop:

```bash
python "SCRIPTS/fetch_and_clean.py" --input "STATE_DIR/search_context_hop{N}.json" --output "STATE_DIR/fetch_results_hop{N}.json"
```

Update each topic's `seen_urls` with the URLs that were successfully fetched, using the `add_seen_urls` state helper. For each topic, pass the list of URLs that ended up in `fetch_results_hop{N}.fetched` (i.e., the URLs that actually returned content, not the failed ones):

```bash
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import add_seen_urls
from pathlib import Path
add_seen_urls(Path('STATE_DIR'), topic_name='TOPIC', urls=URLS_FETCHED_FOR_TOPIC)
"
```

The helper dedupes — calling it again with overlapping URLs (e.g., the same URL appears in multiple hops) is safe.

**If `fetched` is empty and `failed` is non-empty:** treat the hop as a failure for the affected topic(s). The hop-planner in 4e will see zero new sources and decide accordingly. If ALL topics had zero successful fetches, abandon the run and stop (no fetched content means downstream stages have nothing to work with).

### 4c. Media

Before invoking `fetch_media.py`, split this hop's `fetch_results_hop{N}.json` into per-article content files. For each entry in `fetched`, write its `content` field to `STATE_DIR/content_hop{N}_{index}.md` (where `{index}` is the 0-based index of the article in `fetched`). Then run `fetch_media.py` per article:

```bash
python "SCRIPTS/fetch_media.py" --content "STATE_DIR/content_hop{N}_{index}.md" --assets-dir "ASSETS_DIR" --topic "{topic_slug}" --run-id "{RUN_ID}" --output "STATE_DIR/rewritten_hop{N}_{index}.md"
```

Replace the original `content` in `fetch_results_hop{N}` with the rewritten content from the output files.

### 4d. Summarize

Run `summarize.py` over the hop's fetch_results. Write to `summaries_hop{N}.json`.

**If Ollama is available (mid or full tier):**
```bash
python "SCRIPTS/summarize.py" --input "STATE_DIR/fetch_results_hop{N}.json" --model "RECOMMENDED_MODEL" --output "STATE_DIR/summaries_hop{N}.json"
```

**If Ollama is NOT available (base tier):**
```bash
python "SCRIPTS/summarize.py" --input "STATE_DIR/fetch_results_hop{N}.json" --prepare-for-claude --output-dir "STATE_DIR/summaries_hop{N}/"
```

Then dispatch a Haiku subagent per article file (same prompt as v2 base-tier path), collect into `summaries_hop{N}.json` with shape `{"topic": "{project name}", "items": [...]}`. Leave each summary's `media_refs` empty -- media assets are already inlined into the rewritten article content as Obsidian embeds during Stage 4c, so the write stage picks them up directly from the per-hop fetch_results without needing a separate manifest.

### 4e. Hop-planner (parallel per-topic)

For each active topic at this hop level, dispatch the hop-planner agent (Sonnet):

- `subagent_type`: `general-purpose`
- `model`: `sonnet`
- `prompt`: The full contents of `agents/hop-planner.md`, followed by `---`, followed by:

```
topic: {topic.topic}
depth: {topic.depth}
current_hop: {hop_level}
max_hops: {topic.max_hops}
confidence_target: {get_depth_profile(topic.depth)["confidence_target"]}
summaries_so_far: {path to all summaries this topic has collected across all hops}
sources_so_far: {path to all sources this topic has collected}
hop_genealogy: {topic.hop_genealogy as JSON}
seen_urls: {topic.seen_urls}
vault_index_path: {VAULT}/.researcher/vault_index.db
scripts_dir: SCRIPTS
```

**Learned-pattern injection (v3.1.0):** same shape as Stage 4a's learned-pattern injection, but for the hop-planner stage. If `LEARNED_BY_STAGE["hop_planner"]` is non-empty, load each pattern's full record via `load_learned_patterns` (filter by the IDs in `LEARNED_BY_STAGE["hop_planner"]`), append a `## Learned Patterns` block to the hop-planner's dispatch prompt under the existing context, then call `record_applied_pattern(STATE_DIR, pattern_id)` once per surfaced pattern. See Stage 4a for the exact Bash snippets to reuse.

Parse each hop-planner response. **Apply the full transition atomically via `apply_hop_decision()`** -- never via the per-field setters in this stage. The atomic helper persists genealogy + current_hop + confidence_history + contradiction_rate + next_hop / replan_hint / status in a single load -> mutate -> save cycle, so a crash partway through the transition cannot leave a topic with mismatched state (hop recorded but quality signals stale, status updated but routing stale, etc.).

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import apply_hop_decision
from pathlib import Path
state_dir = Path('STATE_DIR')
# HOP_PLANNER_RESPONSE is the parsed JSON from this topic's hop-planner dispatch
# HOP_DATA is the just-completed hop's record (hop number, pattern, queries, sources_kept, ended_at, ...)
decision = HOP_PLANNER_RESPONSE['decision']  # one of: continue, stop, replan
# early_terminated is a special form of stop set when Stage 4a's alternate-pattern
# attempt also failed; the hop-planner doesn't emit it directly -- the orchestrator
# substitutes it before calling apply_hop_decision.
apply_hop_decision(
    state_dir,
    topic_name='TOPIC',
    hop_data=HOP_DATA,
    decision=decision,
    confidence_score=HOP_PLANNER_RESPONSE['confidence_score'],
    contradiction_rate=HOP_PLANNER_RESPONSE['contradiction_rate'],
    next_hop=HOP_PLANNER_RESPONSE.get('next_hop'),       # used only when decision='continue'
    replan_hint=HOP_PLANNER_RESPONSE.get('replan_hint'), # used only when decision='replan'
)
"
```

What each decision atomically does (all three branches always persist confidence + contradiction_rate from the hop-planner response, in addition to the branch-specific writes):

- `continue`: appends `hop_data` to genealogy, increments `current_hop`, appends `confidence_score` to history, overwrites `contradiction_rate`, sets `next_hop` to the planner's pick, clears `replan_hint`, leaves status `active`.
- `stop`: appends `hop_data`, increments `current_hop`, appends `confidence_score`, overwrites `contradiction_rate`, clears `next_hop`, sets status `complete`.
- `early_terminated` (orchestrator-substituted when Stage 4a's alternate-pattern attempt produced zero usable sources): same as `stop` but sets status `early_terminated`.
- `replan`: appends `hop_data`, increments `current_hop`, appends `confidence_score`, overwrites `contradiction_rate`, clears `next_hop`, sets `replan_hint` to the planner's diagnosis, sets status `replan_pending`. Stage 5 handles re-admission.

Stage 4f no longer exists -- quality signals are now part of the atomic 4e transition.

### 4f. Stage transition

When all topics have status != "active", transition to Stage 5:

```bash
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import update_stage
from pathlib import Path
update_stage(Path('STATE_DIR'), 'quality_gate')
"
```

---

## Stage 5: Quality Gate

After all topics have status != "active", compute the run-level quality signals and decide whether to proceed to classify, auto-replan, or prompt the user.

### 5a. Compute per-topic pass/fail

Each topic has its own depth and therefore its own `confidence_target` (via `get_depth_profile(topic.depth)["confidence_target"]`). Check per-topic, not run-aggregate:

```python
from confidence import get_depth_profile

def topic_passes(t) -> bool:
    target = get_depth_profile(t["depth"])["confidence_target"]
    latest_conf = t["confidence_history"][-1] if t["confidence_history"] else 0.0
    return latest_conf >= target and t["contradiction_rate"] <= 0.3

failing_topics = [t for t in run["topics"] if not topic_passes(t)]
```

If `failing_topics` is empty: proceed to Stage 6 (classify).

For diagnostic display and the low-confidence note marker, also compute a "worst-case confidence" proxy across the run:

```python
worst_confidence = min(
    (t["confidence_history"][-1] if t["confidence_history"] else 0.0
     for t in run["topics"]),
    default=0.0,
)
```

This is the value used downstream as `OVERALL_CONFIDENCE` in Stage 5c's user-decision payload and 5d's `final_confidence_score`. There is no single "run target" because depths are per-topic, but the worst-topic confidence is the meaningful number to surface in user prompts and frontmatter callouts.

### 5b. Auto-replan (if eligible)

If `failing_topics` is non-empty AND `replan_count < 2`, run an auto-replan cycle:

1. For each failing topic, decide its hint:
   - If the topic has a stored `replan_hint` from a hop-planner `decision: "replan"`: use it directly.
   - Otherwise: synthesize a hint pointing at the gap (e.g., `{"issue": "thin sources", "suggested_pattern": "entity_expansion", "suggested_query_focus": "official agency data"}`).
2. **Re-admit each failing topic into the hop loop.** A topic that exhausted its initial budget has `current_hop == max_hops`, so Stage 4's admission filter (`current_hop < max_hops`) would otherwise skip it. The re-admission needs to set the hint, bump `max_hops` by 1, mark status `active`, increment `replan_count`, and roll the stage marker back to `hop_loop` -- **all in a single atomic state transition**. Use `apply_replan_readmit()`: a crash partway through must not leave the run with topics flagged active but stage stuck at `quality_gate`.
3. Return to Stage 4 (the hop loop runs one more pass; only re-admitted topics dispatch search/fetch/summarize/hop-planner). Stage 4a's search-agent reads `topic.replan_hint` to bias the next query toward the suggested pattern/focus.

```bash
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import apply_replan_readmit
from pathlib import Path
state_dir = Path('STATE_DIR')
# For each failing topic, pass either its existing replan_hint or a freshly
# synthesized one. Pass None to preserve any existing hint without overwriting.
specs = [
    {'topic_name': t['topic'],
     'replan_hint': SYNTHESIZED_HINT_OR_t['replan_hint']}
    for t in FAILING_TOPICS
]
apply_replan_readmit(state_dir, specs)
"
```

`apply_replan_readmit` does the full transition (set replan_hint, bump max_hops, mark active, increment replan_count, set stage='hop_loop') in one load->mutate->save cycle. Do not call the per-field setters here -- they're not crash-safe across multiple writes.

### 5c. User prompt (auto-replan exhausted)

If `replan_count >= 2`, present the diagnostic. There are two sub-cases:

- **First time the user sees this prompt** (`replan_count == 2`): the two auto-replan attempts have completed and the user can opt into one more focused cycle (`replan`), accept lower-confidence notes (`continue`), or stop (`abandon`).
- **After the user-driven `replan` already fired** (`replan_count >= 3`): no more replans are allowed -- the gate has now spent the initial budget plus two auto-replans plus one user-approved replan. Present only `continue` and `abandon`.

The branch is `>= 2` (not `== 2`) deliberately: this catches the post-manual-replan re-entry to the gate. Without it, a third quality-gate failure would fall through both 5b's `replan_count < 2` guard and the old `== 2` check, leaving the pipeline stuck.

```
⚠ Quality gate triggered after {replan_count} replan attempts.

Topic-by-topic results:
{for each topic:}
  - {topic.topic}: confidence {topic.confidence_history[-1]:.2f}, contradictions {topic.contradiction_rate:.0%}
{end}

Weakest topics:
{for each weak topic:}
  - "{topic}": {gap description}
{end}

Options:
{if replan_count == 2:}
  - replan: try one more cycle with focused hints (1 extension max)
{end}
  - continue: write notes anyway, with low-confidence flags
  - abandon: stop here, preserve search/fetch results for inspection
```

**After `replan_count >= 3`, the user is offered only `continue` or `abandon` -- no more replans.** Do not present `replan` as an option in that case; reject it if the user types it anyway and re-prompt.

Wait for the user's response.

Record the decision:

```bash
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import record_user_decision
from pathlib import Path
record_user_decision(Path('STATE_DIR'), decision='DECISION_VALUE', confidence=OVERALL_CONFIDENCE)
"
```

Branch by decision:

- **`replan`** (only valid when `replan_count == 2`): apply the same re-admission recipe as Stage 5b via the atomic helper (`apply_replan_readmit`). For each failing topic, if its `replan_hint` is None, synthesize one (the user may also supply a manual hint via free-text input -- capture it as the `issue` field). Then dispatch the helper once with all specs:

  ```bash
  python -c "
  import sys
  sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
  from state import apply_replan_readmit
  from pathlib import Path
  state_dir = Path('STATE_DIR')
  specs = [
      {'topic_name': t['topic'],
       'replan_hint': SYNTHESIZED_HINT_OR_t['replan_hint']}
      for t in FAILING_TOPICS
  ]
  apply_replan_readmit(state_dir, specs)
  "
  ```

  This bumps `replan_count` to 3 in the same atomic save that re-admits the topics and rolls `stage` back to `hop_loop`. Return to Stage 4. After this attempt, no more replans -- if it fails again, re-enter Stage 5c with `replan_count == 3` and present only continue / abandon.
- **`continue`**: mark the run with `low_confidence = true` (see 5d). Proceed to Stage 6. The write stage adds body callouts to all written notes.
- **`abandon`**: set `abandoned_at_gate: true` in the run dict, save, then call `abandon_run(STATE_DIR)` (which already exists in state.py and archives via `_archive_run`). Print the archived path so the user can inspect:

  ```bash
  python -c "
  import sys
  sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
  from state import load_run, save_state, abandon_run
  from pathlib import Path
  state_dir = Path('STATE_DIR')
  run = load_run(state_dir)
  if run is not None:
      run['abandoned_at_gate'] = True
      save_state(state_dir, run)
  abandon_run(state_dir)
  "
  ```

  The archived files land under `STATE_DIR/history/{run_id}/` (the existing `_archive_run` destination). Print that path to the user.

### 5d. Save low-confidence flag

If decision was `continue`:

```bash
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import load_run, save_state
from pathlib import Path
run = load_run(Path('STATE_DIR'))
run['low_confidence'] = True
run['final_confidence_score'] = OVERALL_CONFIDENCE
save_state(Path('STATE_DIR'), run)
"
```

---

## Stage 6: Classify

Transition stage first:

```bash
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import update_stage
from pathlib import Path
update_stage(Path('STATE_DIR'), 'classify')
"
```

### 6a. Aggregate per-hop summaries

Before dispatching the classify agent, aggregate all per-hop summary files into a single `summaries.json`:

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from pathlib import Path
state_dir = Path('STATE_DIR')
all_summaries = []
for hop_file in sorted(state_dir.glob('summaries_hop*.json')):
    data = json.loads(hop_file.read_text())
    all_summaries.extend(data.get('items', []))
combined = {'topic': '{project_name}', 'items': all_summaries}
(state_dir / 'summaries.json').write_text(json.dumps(combined, indent=2))
"
```

### 6b. Dispatch classify agent

Read the agent definition: `REPO/agents/classify-agent.md`

Dispatch via the Task tool:
- `subagent_type`: `general-purpose`
- `model`: `haiku`
- `prompt`: The full contents of `agents/classify-agent.md`, followed by a `---` separator, followed by:

```json
{
  "summaries": {the aggregated summaries object from 6a},
  "vault_root": "VAULT",
  "scripts_dir": "SCRIPTS",
  "shared_context_files": {from the research plan}
}
```

**Learned-pattern injection (v3.1.0):** same shape as Stage 4a's learned-pattern injection, but for the classify stage. If `LEARNED_BY_STAGE["classify"]` is non-empty, load each pattern's full record via `load_learned_patterns` (filter by the IDs in `LEARNED_BY_STAGE["classify"]`), append a `## Learned Patterns` block to the classify-agent's dispatch prompt under the existing JSON context, then call `record_applied_pattern(STATE_DIR, pattern_id)` once per surfaced pattern. See Stage 4a for the exact Bash snippets to reuse.

### 6c. Parse classification

The agent returns a single JSON object. Parse it to extract:
- `notes_to_create` -- list of note specs with `title`, `filename`, `folder`, `action`, `type`, `write_model`, `content_summary`, `source_urls`, `tags`, `links`, `stub_links`, `media`, `priority`
- `vault_context` -- `existing_notes_found`, `suggested_moc_update`, `folder_conventions`
- `contradictions_detected` -- list of `{source_a, source_b, claim_a, claim_b, topic}` objects flagging where sources disagree (Phase 5 addition). May be empty.

If `notes_to_create` is empty:
Output: `Classification returned no notes to create. Check fetch results for content quality.`
Complete the run and stop.

### 6d. Save classification

Persist the parsed classify-agent response to `STATE_DIR/classification.json` so Stage 7's resume contract can find it, then advance the stage:

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import update_stage, save_stage_output
from pathlib import Path
state_dir = Path('STATE_DIR')
# CLASSIFICATION_JSON is the parsed JSON object from the classify-agent dispatch in 6b/6c.
save_stage_output(state_dir, 'classification', CLASSIFICATION_JSON)
update_stage(state_dir, 'write')
"
```

Substitute `CLASSIFICATION_JSON` with the parsed dict from Stage 6c, serialized as a Python dict literal.

---

## Stage 7: Write Notes

This is the core stage. **You (the Sonnet orchestrator) write the notes.** For synthesis notes, you escalate to Opus.

### 7.0 OPTIONAL — Delegate the write to the Librarian plugin (feature-flagged, default OFF)

> **This is a "prove the call path" shim, not a full migration.** It demonstrates that researcher *can* hand its note-writing to the standalone Librarian plugin behind a feature flag. The full migration (retiring the inline write path below) is a deliberate fast-follow and is NOT done here. By default this block does nothing and Stage 7 runs exactly as it always has.

**Gate.** Take the Librarian path ONLY if BOTH conditions hold:

1. `config.use_librarian` is `true` (from Stage 0's loaded config; a config missing this key counts as `false`), AND
2. the `librarian` plugin is actually available in this session (its `librarian` skill / `scripts/write_note.py` writer is installed and invokable).

If EITHER condition is false — which is the **default** — skip this entire subsection and proceed to **7a** below. The inline write path (7a–7d) is the unchanged, canonical behavior; nothing about it is modified by this shim, so a run with the flag off is byte-for-byte identical to researcher before Librarian existed.

**If the gate passes**, do the following instead of 7a–7d:

1. **Build Librarian's neutral input contract.** Transform each entry of `classification.notes_to_create[]` into one Librarian note spec. Librarian's writer (`write_note(spec, out_dir)`, invoked via the `librarian` skill) consumes a list of objects shaped:

   `[{title, content, frontmatter_meta, citations, link_hints, priority, action}]`

   plus an optional top-level `vault_context` (pass researcher's `classification.vault_context` through unchanged so Librarian can resolve placement and existing-note context).

   Field mapping, researcher note spec → Librarian neutral contract:

   | researcher note spec field         | Librarian contract field | notes |
   |-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------|
   | `title`                                   | `title`                  | direct pass-through |
   | the authored note body (composed per 7c.v, using `content_summary` as the writing guide) | `content` | **you still author the body here**, applying the same frontmatter/callout/wikilink/sources rules from 7c.v; `content` is the finished Markdown body. `content_summary` is *guidance*, not the body — expand it into full prose as today. |
   | `tags` + `type`                           | `frontmatter_meta`       | merge into one metadata object, e.g. `{ "tags": [...], "type": "..." }` |
   | `source_urls`                             | `citations`              | the source URLs backing the note |
   | `links` + `stub_links`                    | `link_hints`             | concatenate; Librarian decides which become `[[wikilinks]]` vs. stubs |
   | `priority`                                | `priority`               | pass-through (`primary` / `secondary` / `scan`) |
   | `action`                                  | `action`                 | pass-through (`create` / `update`) |

   **Dropped fields (do NOT forward):**
   - `write_model` — researcher's own model-routing concern; Librarian does not consume it.
   - `media` — dead v2 field (empty by design in v3; see 7c.v "Media embeds"). Source-inlined `![[path]]` embeds already live inside the `content` body, so they travel with `content`.
   - `filename` / `folder` — Librarian *derives* placement itself; do not pin it.

2. **Delegate the write.** Hand the assembled spec list (plus `vault_context`) to the Librarian plugin's writer via the `librarian` skill. Librarian performs its own classify → write → wikilink for each spec and writes the notes to the vault.

3. **Reconcile.** After Librarian returns the written-note paths, still run researcher's own bookkeeping so the rest of the pipeline is unaffected: record each written note via `append_written_note` (7c.vii), update progress via `update_stage('write', ...)` (7c.viii), and apply the MOC updates in **7d**. Then skip to Stage 8.

If the Librarian writer errors or is unexpectedly unavailable after the gate passed, fall back to the inline path (7a–7d) so the run still completes.

---

### 7a. Aggregate per-hop fetch results

Stage 4 produces one `fetch_results_hop{N}.json` per hop. Before writing notes, merge them into a single url -> content lookup so 7c.iii (full-source-content recovery) doesn't have to re-glob and re-parse per note. **Write atomically via temp+rename** so a crash mid-write cannot leave a corrupt JSON file on disk — the Resume Flow only rebuilds when the file is missing or unparseable, not when it merely looks "present":

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
from pathlib import Path
state_dir = Path('STATE_DIR')
url_to_entry = {}
for hf in sorted(state_dir.glob('fetch_results_hop*.json')):
    data = json.loads(hf.read_text())
    for entry in data.get('fetched', []):
        # later hops win on URL collisions (same URL re-fetched gets the freshest content)
        url_to_entry[entry['url']] = entry
combined = {'fetched': list(url_to_entry.values()), 'by_url': url_to_entry}
target = state_dir / 'fetch_results_aggregated.json'
tmp = target.with_suffix('.tmp')
tmp.write_text(json.dumps(combined, indent=2), encoding='utf-8')
tmp.replace(target)
"
```

The aggregated file has the same `{"fetched": [...]}` shape as the v2 monolithic `fetch_results.json`, plus a convenience `by_url` index for O(1) lookups. Stage 7c.iii reads from this file.

### 7b. Sort notes by priority tier

Order the `notes_to_create` list:
1. `primary` (deep coverage) -- Tier 1 notes first
2. `secondary` (supporting) -- Tier 2
3. `scan` (brief) -- Tier 3

Writing Tier 1 first ensures that Tier 2 and Tier 3 notes can reference them with wikilinks.

### 7c. For each note, in order:

#### i. Check for mtime conflict

Before writing, check if the target note already exists and was modified after the run started:

```bash
python -c "
import os, json
from datetime import datetime, timezone
path = 'VAULT/FOLDER/FILENAME'
if os.path.exists(path):
    mtime = os.path.getmtime(path)
    run_start = datetime.fromisoformat('RUN_STARTED_AT')
    if run_start.tzinfo is None:
        run_start = run_start.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    file_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(mtime, tz=timezone.utc)
    print(json.dumps({'conflict': file_time > run_start, 'mtime': str(file_time)}))
else:
    print(json.dumps({'conflict': False, 'mtime': None}))
"
```

If `conflict` is true:
- Print a warning: `Skipping "{title}": file was modified after run started (mtime: {mtime}). Manual merge needed.`
- Skip this note and continue to the next.

#### ii. Read context files

Read all files listed in `vault_context.existing_notes_found` using the Read tool. Also read any files listed in this note's `links` that correspond to real vault notes. Store their contents for reference.

#### iii. Read full source content

For each URL in this note's `source_urls`, look it up in `STATE_DIR/fetch_results_aggregated.json` (produced by Stage 7a) -- use the `by_url` index for O(1) access, or scan `fetched[]` if you prefer. Get the full `content` field of the matching entry. This is the source material for writing.

If a `source_urls` entry has no match in the aggregated file (e.g., the URL was selected by the search agent but fetch_and_clean.py failed to retrieve it), skip that URL and log a warning. Continue writing the note using the URLs that did fetch successfully.

#### iv. Determine model

Check the note's `write_model` field:
- `sonnet` -- you write it directly (you are Sonnet).
- `opus` -- this note requires deeper synthesis. You still write the note yourself, but add a note in the frontmatter: `write_model: opus`. The content you produce should reflect the synthesis scope -- connect threads across multiple sources, surface strategic implications, build comprehensive overviews.

#### v. Write the note content

Write the complete note following these rules:

**Frontmatter (YAML):**
```yaml
---
title: "{note title}"
tags: [{tags from classification, comma-separated}]
source: ["{source_urls joined}"]
created: {today's date, YYYY-MM-DD}
write_model: {sonnet or opus}
research_run: {RUN_ID}
confidence: {topic.confidence_history[-1] or 1.0 if single-hop}
contradictions_noted: {true if this note's sources appear in contradictions_detected else false}
primary_sources: {count of sources where is_primary == true}
hop_genealogy: [{list of pattern(from) strings for multi-hop runs, omitted for single-hop}]
---
```

**Body callouts (NEW for v3):**

If `run.low_confidence == true`, prepend this callout to the note body BEFORE the H1:

```
> ⚠ **Research confidence: {run.final_confidence_score:.2f}**. Several topics in this run did not reach the standard confidence target. Verify claims before citing.
```

If any contradiction in `classification.contradictions_detected` references a source URL that overlaps with this note's `source_urls`, prepend (or merge with the prior callout) a contradiction callout:

```
> ⚠ **Source contradictions noted.** Two or more sources disagree on aspects of this topic. See `## Sources` section for details.
```

**Wikilinks:**
- Add `[[wikilinks]]` from the classification's `links` list where the linked topic actually appears in the note content.
- Scan the note content for mentions of other vault notes (from the context files you read) and add `[[wikilinks]]` to them.
- For concepts in `stub_links` that do not have vault notes yet, add `[[stub wikilinks]]` on first mention. Do not create empty stub files.
- Use aliases for long titles: `[[Full Note Title|display text]]`.
- Do not wikilink generic terms -- only link specific, notable concepts worthy of their own note.

**Tags:**
- Use the tags from the classification.
- Verify they follow the taxonomy: content-type tag first (`research`, `legislation`, `campaign`, `plan`, `reference`, `tracking`, `decision`, `index`, `resource`, `meta`), then location tags, then domain tags.
- Limit to 2-5 tags per note.

**Sources:**
- Include the full source URL as an inline link at the point where it is first referenced in the body text.
- Add a `## Sources` section at the bottom listing all source URLs.
- In the Sources list, annotate each URL inline with tier and contradiction notes. Match contradictions by URL: any source URL that appears in a `contradictions_detected[].source_a` or `source_b` gets the contradiction annotation:

  ```
  ## Sources

  - https://source-a/ (T1) -- claims X
  - https://source-b/ (T2) -- claims Y (contradicts source-a on Z)
  ```

- Every factual claim from external research must be traceable to its source.

**Format matching:**
- If `action` is `update`, read the existing note first and merge new information into it. Expand sections. Never discard existing content.
- If the target `folder` contains existing notes (from `vault_context`), match their section structure and style.

**Media embeds:**
- Media embeds are already inlined into the source article content during Stage 4c (`fetch_media.py` rewrites the article body to include `![[path/to/asset]]` references in place). When composing the note body from the source content, preserve any `![[path]]` references found there -- do not strip them.
- Do not add new embeds from the classification's `note.media` field; that field is empty by design in v3 (the manifest-based media flow was replaced by inline embeds). The field is retained in the classification schema for backwards compatibility with v2 vault notes only.

**Content:**
- For `create`: Write the complete note from scratch using the fetched source content and `content_summary` as your guide.
- For `update`: Merge new information into the existing note. Preserve and expand sections. Never remove existing content.

#### vi. Save the note

- `create`: Write to `VAULT/{folder}/{filename}` using the Write tool. Create the folder first if needed via Bash: `mkdir -p "VAULT/{folder}"`
- `update`: Write to the existing note path using the Write tool.

#### vii. Track the written note

Run via Bash:
```bash
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import append_written_note
from pathlib import Path
append_written_note(Path('STATE_DIR'), 'TOPIC', 'NOTE_PATH', 'MODEL')
"
```

#### viii. Update progress

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import update_stage
from pathlib import Path
update_stage(Path('STATE_DIR'), 'write', {'total_notes': TOTAL, 'completed': COMPLETED, 'current': 'CURRENT_TITLE'})
"
```

### 7d. Update MOC files

After all notes are written:

1. If `vault_context.suggested_moc_update` is not null, read that MOC file and add/update entries for the notes written in this batch. Match the MOC's existing format exactly.

2. For each folder that received new notes, check if it contains a file starting with `_` or containing `MOC`, `Index`, `Hub`, or `Overview` that was not already processed. If found, update it too.

---

## Stage 8: Wikilink Scan

After all notes and MOCs are written, scan for wikilink opportunities between the new notes and existing project notes. Transition stage first:

```bash
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import update_stage
from pathlib import Path
update_stage(Path('STATE_DIR'), 'wikilink_scan')
"
```

### 8a. Refresh vault index

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from vault_index import update_index
from pathlib import Path
stats = update_index(Path('VAULT'))
print(json.dumps(stats))
"
```

This ensures the newly written notes are indexed before the scanner queries the vault.

### 8b. Determine project folder

From the written notes list, extract the common parent folder. For example, if notes were written to `Projects/Activism/BJU/Bob Jones University.md` and `Projects/Activism/BJU/GRACE Report on Bob Jones University.md`, the project folder is `Projects/Activism/BJU`.

### 8c. Dispatch wikilink-scanner agent

Read the agent definition: `REPO/agents/wikilink-scanner.md`

Load the written notes list:
```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import load_stage_output
from pathlib import Path
written = load_stage_output(Path('STATE_DIR'), 'written_notes')
print(json.dumps(written))
"
```

Dispatch via the Task tool:
- `subagent_type`: `general-purpose`
- `model`: `haiku`
- `prompt`: The full contents of `agents/wikilink-scanner.md`, followed by a `---` separator, followed by:

```json
{
  "new_notes": [{list of {path, title} from written_notes}],
  "project_folder": "{project folder vault-relative path}",
  "vault_root": "VAULT",
  "scripts_dir": "SCRIPTS"
}
```

### 8d. Parse and apply edits

The agent returns a JSON object with `edits` and `stats`.

For each edit in the `edits` array:
1. Read the target file using the Read tool
2. Find the first occurrence of `edit.find` in the file content, using `edit.context` for disambiguation if needed
3. Replace it with `edit.replace` using the Edit tool
4. If the `find` text is not found (perhaps already wikilinked or content changed), skip it and log a warning

### 8e. Report results

Log the results:
```
Wikilink scan: {stats.total_edits} edits applied
  New notes: +{stats.wikilinks_in_new_notes} wikilinks
  Existing notes: +{stats.wikilinks_in_existing_notes} wikilinks to new notes
```

If no edits were needed, log: `Wikilink scan: no new wikilinks needed.`

### 8f. Update state

```bash
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import update_stage
from pathlib import Path
update_stage(Path('STATE_DIR'), 'discover')
"
```

---

## Stage 9: Discover Threads

### 9a. Dispatch thread-discoverer agent

Read the agent definition: `REPO/agents/thread-discoverer.md`

Load the written notes list:
```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import load_stage_output
from pathlib import Path
written = load_stage_output(Path('STATE_DIR'), 'written_notes')
print(json.dumps(written))
"
```

Dispatch via the Task tool:
- `subagent_type`: `general-purpose`
- `model`: `haiku`
- `prompt`: The full contents of `agents/thread-discoverer.md`, followed by a `---` separator, followed by:

```json
{
  "project": "{project name}",
  "summaries": {the summaries items from Stage 6},
  "written_notes": {written notes list},
  "vault_root": "VAULT",
  "scripts_dir": "SCRIPTS"
}
```

### 9b. Parse thread proposals

The agent returns a JSON object with `threads` (sorted by score descending) and `batch_stats`.

### 9c. Present to user

Show the user:
```
Threads discovered from {project}:
{for each thread:}
  {index}. {topic} (score: {score}, {novelty_status})
     {rationale}
{end}

Batch stats: {total_entities_found} entities, {leads_above_threshold} leads above threshold

Research any of these? [1,2,3] / all / none
```

Wait for user response:
- **none:** Proceed to Stage 10.
- **all:** Save all threads as the next batch input.
- **specific numbers:** Save only the selected threads.

If threads are approved, save them to `STATE_DIR/approved_threads.json` for a follow-up `/researcher` invocation. Do NOT start a new pipeline run within this run.

---

## Stage 10: Complete

**Important sequencing:** `complete_run()` archives the state file (moves it under `history/{run_id}/`), so any `load_run()` call AFTER `complete_run()` returns `None`. Stage 10's telemetry, hop genealogy print, and case-record write must all use the dict returned BY `complete_run()` -- not call `load_run()` after the fact.

### 10a. Complete the run (capture final state)

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import complete_run
from pathlib import Path
final = complete_run(Path('STATE_DIR'))
print(json.dumps(final))
"
```

Parse the printed JSON. This is the FINAL run dict (with `completed_at` set). The state file has been moved to history at this point -- do NOT call `load_run` again.

Write the `final` JSON to a temp file (e.g., `STATE_DIR/../tmp/final_run.json`) so Stage 10c can re-read it without depending on shell-variable passing.

### 10b. Print summary

Using the `final` dict from 10a, format and print:

```
Research complete: {project}

Created ({count} notes):
{for each:}
  - {path} (confidence {confidence})
{end}

Updated:
{for each updated note/MOC:}
  - {path}
{end}

Hop genealogy:
{for each topic:}
  Topic: {topic} ({hop_count} hops, confidence {confidence}{", " + status if status != "complete"})
  {for each hop in genealogy:}
    Hop {n} ({pattern or "initial"}): {sources_kept} sources kept
  {end}
{end}

Model usage:
  Haiku:   {haiku.calls} calls,  {haiku.in_tokens:,} in / {haiku.out_tokens:,} out
  Sonnet:  {sonnet.calls} calls, {sonnet.in_tokens:,} in / {sonnet.out_tokens:,} out
  Opus:    {opus.calls} call(s), {opus.in_tokens:,} in / {opus.out_tokens:,} out
  Ollama: {ollama.calls} calls (local -- no token cost)

Estimated cost: ${estimated_cost:.2f}

{if low_confidence:}
⚠ Low confidence run (score {final_confidence_score}). Notes marked with low-confidence callouts.
{end}

{if threads approved:}
Threads queued for follow-up:
  - {topic} (priority: {priority})
  Run /researcher again to execute these.
{end}

Tier: {TIER} | Sources fetched: {total} | Notes written: {count} | Replans: {replan_count}
```

Cost estimation (rough):
- Haiku: $0.25/M input + $1.25/M output
- Sonnet: $3/M input + $15/M output
- Opus: $15/M input + $75/M output

Sum across models for the estimate.

### 10c. Write case record

Using the same `final` dict from 10a (do NOT re-read state -- it's archived already):

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from state import write_case_record
from pathlib import Path
cases_dir = Path('CASES_DIR')

# 'final' was captured from complete_run() in stage 10a; pass it via stdin or a temp file
import json as _json
final = _json.loads(open('FINAL_JSON_TEMP_FILE').read())

case = {
    'case_id': final['run_id'],
    'version': 1,
    'query': 'PROJECT_NAME',
    'domain_tags': DERIVED_TAGS,
    'strategy_used': final.get('strategy', 'unified'),
    'depths_used': {d: sum(1 for t in final['topics'] if t.get('depth') == d)
                    for d in ['quick','standard','deep','exhaustive']},
    'hops_executed': sum(len(t.get('hop_genealogy', [])) for t in final['topics']),
    'confidence_per_topic': {t['topic']: (t['confidence_history'][-1] if t.get('confidence_history') else None)
                             for t in final['topics']},
    'contradiction_rate': max((t.get('contradiction_rate', 0.0) for t in final['topics']), default=0.0),
    'patterns_that_worked': PATTERNS_WORKED,
    'patterns_that_failed': PATTERNS_FAILED,
    'applied_patterns': final.get('applied_patterns', []),
    'outcomes': {
        'sources_processed': SOURCES_COUNT,
        'notes_created': CREATED_COUNT,
        'notes_updated': UPDATED_COUNT,
        'user_decisions': final.get('user_decisions', []),
    },
}
write_case_record(cases_dir, case)
"
```

The orchestrator writes `final` to a temp JSON file between 10a and 10c (typical pattern: write the captured JSON to `STATE_DIR/../tmp/final_run.json` for the duration of 10b/10c, then delete). DERIVED_TAGS comes from the most common tags across written notes. PATTERNS_WORKED / PATTERNS_FAILED come from per-hop telemetry (patterns that produced novel notes vs. dead ends).

### 10d. Run case analyzer (v3.1.0)

Run via Bash:

```bash
python -c "
import sys, json
sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from case_analyzer import analyze
from pathlib import Path
from state import acquire_state_lock

with acquire_state_lock(Path('STATE_ROOT_FOR_VAULT')):
    result = analyze(
        case_path=Path('CASE_PATH'),
        accumulator_path=Path('ACCUMULATOR_PATH'),
        learned_patterns_path=Path('LEARNED_PATTERNS_PATH'),
        cases_dir=Path('CASES_DIR'),
    )
print(json.dumps({
    'promotion_candidates': [
        {'pattern_id': c.pattern_id, 'name': c.name,
         'proposed_promotion_body': c.proposed_promotion_body,
         'evidence': c.evidence}
        for c in result.promotion_candidates
    ],
    'contradictions': result.contradictions,
    'warnings': result.warnings,
    'score_updates_applied': result.score_updates_applied,
    'demotions_applied': result.demotions_applied,
}))
"
```

Substitute `STATE_ROOT_FOR_VAULT` with `{VAULT}/.researcher/`, `CASE_PATH` with the path to the just-written case JSON (under `{VAULT}/.researcher/cases/`), `ACCUMULATOR_PATH` with `{VAULT}/.researcher/accumulator.json`, `LEARNED_PATTERNS_PATH` with `{VAULT}/.researcher/learned_patterns.md`, and `CASES_DIR` with `{VAULT}/.researcher/cases/`.

Parse the JSON output.

**Corruption handling (v3.1.0 policy: no automatic recovery, no rebuild UX).**

`analyze()` itself protects state files: if `accumulator.json` or `learned_patterns.md` could not be parsed (or had a schema-version mismatch), the analyzer **does not write back to that file**. So a corrupt file stays as-is on disk -- the user can inspect or recover it. The trade-off is that any in-memory updates (score increments, new candidates, demotion sweep results) that would have touched the corrupted store are discarded for this run.

If `warnings` contains any of these markers:
- `accumulator_corrupted: ...`
- `accumulator_schema_mismatch: ...`
- `learned_patterns_corrupted: ...`
- `learned_patterns_schema_mismatch: ...`

Surface them to the user at Stage 10d output (these flow through to Stage 10's completion summary anyway via state telemetry), with a clear advisory:

```
WARNING: v3.1.0 pattern learning state was not updated this run:
  {warning text(s) from analyzer}

To reset the affected store, delete the file manually:
  {VAULT}/.researcher/accumulator.json
  {VAULT}/.researcher/learned_patterns.md
The next /researcher run will start with an empty store and rebuild from
new cases going forward. Existing case history at
{VAULT}/.researcher/cases/ is unaffected.
```

(There is no in-pipeline rebuild flow in v3.1.0. Corrupt-state recovery is rare; the simpler "user deletes file -> fresh start" path was preferred over carrying the complexity of a rebuild-from-history mechanism. Revisit in v3.1.x if real usage shows this is too coarse.)

**Stage 10e gating.** If any `learned_patterns_*` OR `accumulator_*` warning is present, **skip Stage 10e entirely for this run** -- even if `promotion_candidates` is non-empty. Stage 10e's promote/reject/hold branches would otherwise be unable to safely write the affected store (analyzer refused the write, so the load returns empty + warning, and a save would clobber the recoverable file). Log: "Skipping graduation prompts -- `learned_patterns.md` or `accumulator.json` needs manual repair first."

**Normal flow after warnings handling.**

If `promotion_candidates` is non-empty AND no `learned_patterns_*` or `accumulator_*` warnings, proceed to Stage 10e. Otherwise skip 10e.

If the analyzer fails entirely (script exits non-zero or LockTimeoutError raised), log to state telemetry and continue silently. The run still completes; the analyzer just didn't update state this round.

### 10e. Graduation prompt (v3.1.0, conditional on Stage 10d output)

For each entry in `promotion_candidates`:

Look up any matching entries in `contradictions` (where `candidate_pattern_id == entry.pattern_id`). If present, include a `Possible contradiction` block in the prompt so the user can weigh whether the new pattern conflicts with an existing graduated one.

Show the user:

```
Learned pattern ready for promotion:

  Name: {name}
  Proposed body: {proposed_promotion_body}

  Evidence:
  {for each row in evidence:}
    - case {case_id}: {signal}
  {end}

  {if contradictions for this entry:}
  WARNING: Possible contradiction with already-graduated patterns
      in the same domain x stage:
  {for each conflicting_name:}
    - {conflicting_name} (id: {conflicting_id})
  {end}
  Promoting both keeps them side-by-side and lets the scoring loop
  sort it out. Rejecting this new pattern preserves the existing rule.
  {end}

Promote / Reject / Hold?
```

Use the user's response:

All three branches below acquire `acquire_state_lock` around the shared-state writes. This is the same lock Stage 10d uses -- without it, concurrent `/researcher` runs (background + foreground) could race on `accumulator.json` and `learned_patterns.md` and lose updates. `STATE_ROOT_FOR_VAULT` is `{VAULT}/.researcher/`.

**Precondition for all three branches:** Stage 10d already verified that BOTH `learned_patterns.md` AND `accumulator.json` are parseable (no `learned_patterns_*` and no `accumulator_*` warnings) BEFORE letting control reach Stage 10e. If any such warning was present, Stage 10d skipped 10e entirely. So inside each branch we can assume the loaders return a usable file -- but every branch still defends against late corruption by checking warnings before saving (`BRANCH_ABORTED` on mismatch). The Reject and Hold branches would otherwise silently overwrite a recoverable corrupt accumulator with empty content.

**Promote:**

```bash
python -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from accumulator import load_accumulator, save_accumulator, remove_entry
from learned_patterns import (
    load_learned_patterns, save_learned_patterns, LearnedPattern
)
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from pathlib import Path
from state import acquire_state_lock

with acquire_state_lock(Path('STATE_ROOT_FOR_VAULT')):
    lp, lp_warnings = load_learned_patterns(Path('LEARNED_PATTERNS_PATH'))
    if lp_warnings:
        # Refuse to clobber a corrupt/incompatible file even if Stage 10d
        # missed the gate (defense in depth). Log and bail.
        import sys as _sys
        print(f'BRANCH_ABORTED: refusing to save over corrupt learned_patterns.md: {lp_warnings}', file=_sys.stderr)
        _sys.exit(0)
    acc, acc_warnings = load_accumulator(Path('ACCUMULATOR_PATH'))
    if acc_warnings:
        # Same defense for the accumulator side -- without this check the
        # next(...) lookup below would raise StopIteration on the empty
        # fallback, masking the real failure with an opaque crash.
        import sys as _sys
        print(f'BRANCH_ABORTED: refusing to save over corrupt accumulator.json: {acc_warnings}', file=_sys.stderr)
        _sys.exit(0)
    entry = next(e for e in acc.entries if e.pattern_id == 'PATTERN_ID')
    # Skip if already in learned_patterns (cross-file transaction recovery --
    # prior promotion wrote learned_patterns but failed to update accumulator)
    if not any(p.id == entry.pattern_id for p in lp.patterns):
        lp.patterns.append(LearnedPattern(
            id=entry.pattern_id,
            name=entry.name,
            body=entry.proposed_promotion_body,
            domain_tags=entry.domain_tags,
            target_stage=entry.target_stage,
            category=entry.category,
            wins=0, losses=0,
            promoted_at=datetime.now(timezone.utc).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
            demotion_count=entry.demotion_count,
        ))
        # Write order: learned_patterns FIRST, then accumulator
        save_learned_patterns(Path('LEARNED_PATTERNS_PATH'), lp)
    remove_entry(acc, 'PATTERN_ID')
    save_accumulator(Path('ACCUMULATOR_PATH'), acc)
"
```

**Reject:**

```bash
python -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from accumulator import load_accumulator, save_accumulator, mark_rejected
from pathlib import Path
from state import acquire_state_lock

with acquire_state_lock(Path('STATE_ROOT_FOR_VAULT')):
    acc, acc_warnings = load_accumulator(Path('ACCUMULATOR_PATH'))
    if acc_warnings:
        # Defense in depth: Stage 10d should have skipped 10e if the
        # accumulator was corrupt, but without this guard a `mark_rejected`
        # + `save_accumulator` on the empty fallback would clobber the
        # recoverable corrupt file with empty content.
        import sys as _sys
        print(f'BRANCH_ABORTED: refusing to save over corrupt accumulator.json: {acc_warnings}', file=_sys.stderr)
        _sys.exit(0)
    mark_rejected(acc, 'PATTERN_ID')
    save_accumulator(Path('ACCUMULATOR_PATH'), acc)
"
```

**Hold:**

```bash
python -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'SCRIPTS')
from accumulator import load_accumulator, save_accumulator, clear_promotion_pending
from pathlib import Path
from state import acquire_state_lock

with acquire_state_lock(Path('STATE_ROOT_FOR_VAULT')):
    acc, acc_warnings = load_accumulator(Path('ACCUMULATOR_PATH'))
    if acc_warnings:
        # Same defense as Reject -- a `clear_promotion_pending` +
        # `save_accumulator` on the empty fallback would clobber the
        # recoverable corrupt file with empty content.
        import sys as _sys
        print(f'BRANCH_ABORTED: refusing to save over corrupt accumulator.json: {acc_warnings}', file=_sys.stderr)
        _sys.exit(0)
    clear_promotion_pending(acc, 'PATTERN_ID')
    save_accumulator(Path('ACCUMULATOR_PATH'), acc)
"
```

If the user aborts (Ctrl+C, dismisses, walks away), do nothing. The `promotion_pending` flag remains set on the accumulator entry, and next-run Stage 10e will re-prompt.

---

## Error Handling

Throughout the pipeline, follow these principles:

1. **Failures do not stop the pipeline.** If a single fetch fails, a media download fails, or a summarization fails, log the error and continue. Collect all errors and report them in the final summary at Stage 10.

2. **State checkpoint after every stage.** Always call `update_stage()` before starting the next stage. If the pipeline crashes, the user can resume from the last checkpoint.

3. **Shared context by file path.** Write intermediate results to `STATE_DIR/` and reference them by path in agent prompts. Never duplicate large content blobs in agent prompts.

4. **Mtime checks before writing.** Always check if the target note was modified externally before overwriting. Skip and warn if it was.

5. **Atomic state updates.** Use `save_stage_output()` for all state file writes -- it uses temp file + rename for crash safety.

---

## Resume Flow

When resuming a run (Stage 1 detected an active run and the user chose "Resume"):

1. Read `current_run.json` to find the current `stage` -- one of `triage`, `resolve`, `hop_loop`, `quality_gate`, `classify`, `write`, `wikilink_scan`, `discover`, `complete`.
2. Load any saved stage outputs from `STATE_DIR/`:
   - `research_plan.json` (from Stage 3)
   - `search_context_hop{N}.json` and `fetch_results_hop{N}.json` (per-hop, from Stage 4)
   - `summaries_hop{N}.json` (per-hop, from Stage 4d) and aggregated `summaries.json` (from Stage 6a)
   - `classification.json` (from Stage 6d)
   - `fetch_results_aggregated.json` (from Stage 7a -- regenerate if missing OR if loading it raises `JSONDecodeError` on resume into the write stage)
   - `written_notes.json` (from Stage 7)
3. Skip to the recorded stage. For the `hop_loop` stage, the topics' `current_hop` and `status` fields determine which active topics still need processing -- only un-completed topics dispatch through Stage 4 again. For the `write` stage specifically, check `written_notes.json` to determine which notes are already complete and skip them. If `fetch_results_aggregated.json` is missing OR `json.loads()` on its contents raises `JSONDecodeError` (the prior run crashed mid-write before the temp+rename completed), re-run the Stage 7a aggregation snippet -- it's a pure function of the existing per-hop files, so regeneration is safe.
4. Continue the pipeline from that point.
