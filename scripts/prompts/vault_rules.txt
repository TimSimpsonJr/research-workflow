## Vault Note Rules

Apply these rules when generating content that will be saved as a note in an Obsidian vault. If generating content for external publishing (web article, social post, etc.), apply only the Citations & Sources rules below — skip Wikilinks and Tagging.

### Wikilinks

- Add [[wikilinks]] for specific people, organizations, legislation, campaigns, or topics mentioned in the content that could reasonably have their own vault note.
- For concepts that don't have existing notes yet but are worth exploring later, add [[stub wikilinks]] and include a brief inline note about what to research (e.g., "[[Topic Name]] — worth investigating further for connection to X").
- Do not create wikilinks for generic terms. Only link specific, notable concepts worthy of their own note.
- Use aliases for long titles when needed: [[Full Note Title|display text]]

### Citations & Sources

- Include full URLs of web sources as inline links at the point where they are first referenced.
- Add a ## Sources section at the bottom of the note listing all source URLs used.
- Every factual claim drawn from external research should be traceable to its source.

### Tagging

Include tags in YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
tags: [content-type, location, other-relevant-tags]
```

- Start with a content-type tag: research, legislation, campaign, plan, reference, tracking, decision, index, resource, meta
- Add location tags (greenville-sc, sc, etc.) if the content discusses specific places
- Add purpose prefixes (strategic-, tactical-) if the content informs decisions or implementation
- Use area- prefix only for genuinely ambiguous notes spanning multiple categories
