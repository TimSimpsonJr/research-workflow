Based on the research above, draft social media content. If a platform or constraint is specified in the context, follow it exactly. Otherwise, default to a Twitter/X thread of 5-8 posts. Each post should be self-contained but flow as a series. Lead with the most compelling fact or finding. Include a clear call to action in the final post. Do not use hashtags unless the context specifies a platform where they are conventional.
