Based on the research above, write a documentary-style video script. Structure it with: an opening hook (narration over establishing visuals), 3-5 main segments each with narration text and suggested b-roll descriptions in [brackets], suggested interview questions for potential subjects, and a closing segment. Format clearly with NARRATION, B-ROLL, and INTERVIEW PROMPT labels. Aim for a tone that is informative and compelling without being sensationalist.
